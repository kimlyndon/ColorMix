# Color Mix
## iBook Project

This project encompasses the use of actions and outlets, switches, and sliders to mix and create colors. A viewer at the top of the screen changes to an assigned color as the coordinating switch is turned on. That color's brightness can be modified with the accompanying slider. Combinations may be made to create a new color in the viewer.
